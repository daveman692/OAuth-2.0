Abstract

   OAuth 2.0 provides a method for an application (client) to access the
   Protected Resource hosted on a server on behalf of a resource owner
   (such as a different client or an end-user).  It provides a process
   for users to authorize third-party access to their protected
   resources via a variety of authorization profiles.  These profiles
   generally do not include having to share their credentials
   (typically, a username and password pair).  A server can additionally
   delegate authorization to one or more authorities (authorization
   server) which issue access tokens to clients.

Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 DRAFT                    Mar 2010


1.  Introduction

   This specification consists of two major parts: Getting an Access
   Token (Section 2) and Accessing a Protected Resource (Section 4).
   The first part defines multiple authorization profiles describing how
   a client may obtain an access token when acting autonomously or on
   behalf of an end-user.  They involve resource owners authorizing
   client access to their resources, by authenticating directly with the
   server and provisioning tokens to the client for use with the
   authentication method.  The second part defines a method for making
   authenticated HTTP requests using access tokens either protected via
   TLS/SSL or by using an access token combined with an access token
   secret.  The access token both identifies the client making the
   request as well as the resource owner on whose behalf the request is
   being made.

   The use of OAuth with any other transport protocol than HTTP
   [RFC2616] is undefined.

   TODO: This section should provide a longer description of the
   protocol flows and the evolution from OAuth 1.0.  Both OAuth 1.0 and
   WRAP contain fairly complete introductory sections.  I think that the
   WRAP one is a bit too long and we should shoot for this section being
   a little over two pages (including terminology).

1.1.  Acknowledgements

   This (early) draft was written pretty quickly and is heavily based on
   The OAuth 1.0 Protocol [draft-hammer-oauth-10], OAuth WRAP
   [draft-hardt-oauth-01] and further discussion on the IETF OAuth
   Working Group mailing list [1].  Those authors and editors include
   Allen Tom (Yahoo!), Brian Eaton (Google), Dick Hardt, Eran Hammer-
   Lahav (Yahoo!) and Yaron Goland (Microsoft).

   To provide feedback on this draft join the OAuth Working Group:
   http://www.ietf.org/dyn/wg/charter/oauth-charter.html.

1.2.  Terminology

   TODO: The terminology should be based on updated OAuth 1.0
   terminology which is already close to the WRAP terminology as well.
   We should err on the side of more generally understood terms.

   access token  An unique identifier issued by the authorization server
      and used by the client to make authenticated requests on behalf of
      the user whose authorization has been obtained by the client.
      TODO (rephrase): When using SSL it is a short lived bearer token
      and when using signatures it is accompanied by an additional

      secret.

   authorization server  A server that issues access tokens to clients
      after successful authorization.  May be the same entity as the
      server hosting protected resources.

   client  An HTTP client (per [RFC2616]) capable of making OAuth-
      authenticed requests for protected resources.

   client identifier  An unique identifier issued by the authorization
      server and used used by the client to identify itself to the
      authorization server.

   client secret:  An unique identifier issued by the authorization
      server and used by the client to establish ownership of the client
      identifier.

   protected resource  An access-restricted resource which can be
      obtained from the server using an OAuth-authenticated request.
      May be the same entity as the authorization server.

   refresh token  An unique long lived bearer token used by a client to
      acquire access tokens from an authorization server.

   resource owner  An entity (generally an end-user) who can
      authenticate to the authorization server such that it issues the
      client an access token.

   server  An HTTP server (per [RFC2616]) capable of accepting OAuth-
      authenticated requests.

1.2.1.  Endpoints

   The authorization server MUST advertise the URIs of the following
   three endpoints:

   access token request  The authorization server endpoint used by the
      client to obtain an access token via a HTTP "POST" request using
      one of the authorization profiles (Section 2) or by refreshing an
      access token (Section 3).

   API request  The protected resource endpoint used by the client to
      make OAuth-authenticated requests (Section 4).

   user authorization request  The authorization server endpoint where
      the client sends the resource owners's user-agent via a HTTP "GET"
      request to make an authorization decision using one of the
      authorization profiles (Section 2).

Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 DRAFT                    Mar 2010


   The three URIs advertised by the server MAY include a query component
   as defined by [RFC3986] section 3, but if present, the query MUST NOT
   contain any parameters beginning with the "oauth_" prefix, to avoid
   conflicts with the protocol parameters added to the URIs when used.

   The methods in which the servers advertise and document its three
   endpoints are beyond the scope of this specification.  Clients should
   avoid making assumptions about the size of tokens and other server-
   generated values, which are left undefined by this specification.  In
   addition, protocol parameters MAY include values which require
   encoding when transmitted.  Clients and servers should not make
   assumptions about the possible range of their values.

1.3.  Notational Conventions

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].


2.  Getting an Access Token

   This specification defines six core authorization profiles which are
   used by a client to request an access token from authorization
   servers.  An authorization server MUST implement at least one of the
   following profiles.

   Common scenarios involve the resource owner delegating to a client to
   act on their behalf, adding another party (the resource owner) to the
   protocol.  In these profiles, the client receives a refresh token
   when it acquires the first access token.  When an access token
   expires, the client presents the refresh token to acquire a new
   access token.  Refresh tokens are sensitive as they represent long-
   lived permissions to access a Protected Resource and are always
   transmitted using HTTPS.

   Unlike the others, Client Identifier and Secret profile (Section 2.6)
   is not intended for a client acting on behalf of itself and not a
   separate resource owner.  For example, when a client is accessing
   non-private data or modifying data about itself.

2.1.  Web App Profile

   The updated OAuth 1.0 spec could also be useful for more complete
   language around the Web App Profile though we should also draw from
   Luke Shepard's JavaScript profile (which needs updating).  I believe
   the main difference is the security characteristics.

2.2.  Pure Client Profile

   The Pure Client Profile is similar to the Web App Profile
   (Section 2.1), but it has different security characteristics.  Pure
   client apps are applications that live entirely in JavaScript, on the
   desktop, a mobile device, or in other environments where the code
   does not have easy access to a server.  These applications have the
   ability to display a web page to the user, but cannot receive the
   response on a server.  Because the entirety of the client is
   downloaded to the resource owner's user-agent, it is not possible to
   completely protect the client secret.  This profile allows for
   authorization while taking those security considerations into
   account.

   Because there is no client secret to ensure authenticity, both the
   client and authorization server should take some extra precautions
   when using this profile.  Specifically, as the access token flows
   directly to the user-agent, it should only be used when it is
   acceptable for the end-user to have direct access to the access
   token.  Additionally, care should be taken to choose a good callback
   URL, as described below.

   Prior to making a request using this profile, the client MUST have
   obtained a client identifier and user authorization request endpoint
   URI from the authorization server.  The authorization server MAY
   require the client to pre-register their callback URI.

   The client MUST first send the resource owners's user-agent to the
   authorization server's user authorization request endpoint.  The
   client constructs the request URI by adding the following REQUIRED
   query parameters to the user authorization endpoint URI:

   oauth_mode  The parameter value MUST be set to "profile_pure_client"
      (case sensitive).

   oauth_client_identifier  The client identifier.

   oauth_callback_url  An absolute URI to which the authorization server
      will redirect the resource owner back when the resource owner
      authorization step is completed.  The client MUST either make use
      of a transport-layer mechanism such as TLS or SSL (or a secure
      channel with equivalent protections) for the callback URI or
      include a fragment identifier ("#") as defined by [RFC3986]
      section 3.5 in the URI to prevent transmission of plain text
      credentials.

   The client MAY also include the following OPTIONAL parameters:

Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 DRAFT                    Mar 2010


   oauth_client_state  An opaque value that clients can use to maintain
      state associated with this request.

   oauth_scope  If the authorization server has defined a manner for the
      client to request certain capabilities of the access token, this
      parameter SHOULD be used to do so.

   The client directs the resource owner to the constructed URI using an
   HTTP redirection response, or by other means available to it via the
   resource owner's user-agent.  The request MUST use the HTTP "GET"
   method.

   For example, the client directs the resource owner's user-agent to
   make one of the following HTTPS requests:

    GET /user_authorization?oauth_client_only=true&oauth_client_identifier=s6BhdRkqt3&oauth_callback_url=https%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com


    GET /user_authorization?oauth_client_only=true&oauth_client_identifier=s6BhdRkqt3&oauth_callback_url=http%3A%2F%2Fclient%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fcb# HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com

   The way in which the server handles the user authorization request,
   including whether it uses a secure channel such as TLS/SSL is beyond
   the scope of this specification.  However, the server MUST first
   verify the identity of the resource owner.

   After receiving an authorization decision from the resource owner,
   the server redirects the resource owner to the callback URI if one
   was provided in the "oauth_callback" parameter or pre-registered by
   other means.  The authorization server constructs the request URI by
   adding the following REQUIRED parameters to the callback URI query
   component:

   oauth_access_token  The access token.

   The authorization server MAY also include the following parameters:

   oauth_access_token_expires_in  The lifetime of the access token in
      seconds.

   oauth_refresh_token  The refresh token.

   If the callback URI already includes a query component as defined by
   [RFC3986] section 3, the server MUST append the OAuth parameters to
   the end of the existing query.  The callback URI's query component
   MUST NOT contain any parameters beginning with the "oauth_" prefix.

Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 DRAFT                    Mar 2010


   For example, the server redirects the resource owner's user-agent to
   make one of the following HTTPS/HTTP "GET" requests:

    GET /cb?oauth_access_token=FJQbwq9OD8&oauth_access_token_expires_in=10800 HTTP/1.1
    Host: client.example.com


    GET /cb#?oauth_access_token=FJQbwq9OD8&oauth_access_token_expires_in=10800 HTTP/1.1
    Host: client.example.com

   The server must retain the scope, duration, and other attributes
   approved by the resource owner, and enforce these restrictions when
   receiving a client request made with the tokens issued.

   Once the client receives and stores the token credentials, it can
   proceed to access protected resources on behalf of the resource owner
   by making authenticated requests (Section 4) using the access token
   received.

   If the request fails verification, the authorization server SHOULD
   respond with the appropriate HTTP response status code.  The
   authorization server MAY include further details about why the
   request was rejected in the response body.

   For example:

       HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
       WWW-Authenticate: OAuth realm="https://server.example.com/"

2.3.  Rich App Profile

   For desktop applications which can open or embed a web browser.

2.4.  Device Profile

   The Device Profile is suitable when the client is a device which does
   not have an easy data-entry method (e.g. game consoles or
   entertainment centers), but where the end-user has access to a
   separate computer with simple data-entry methods (e.g. their home
   computer, a laptop or a smartphone).

   Prior to making a request using this profile, the client MUST have
   obtained a client identifier and access token request endpoint URI
   from the authorization server.

   The client constructs an HTTP "POST" request to the access token
   request endpoint and includes the following REQUIRED parameters:

Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 DRAFT                    Mar 2010


   oauth_mode  The parameter value MUST be set to "profile_device" (case
      sensitive).

   oauth_client_identifier  The client identifier.

   The client MAY also include the following OPTIONAL parameters:

   oauth_scope  If the authorization server has defined a manner for the
      client to request certain capabilities of the access token, this
      parameter SHOULD be used to do so.

   Since the request results in the transmission of temporary plain text
   credentials in the HTTP response, the authorization server MUST
   require the use of a transport-layer mechanism such as TLS or SSL (or
   a secure channel with equivalent protections).

   For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request:

      POST /access_token HTTP/1.1
      Host: server.example.com
      oauth_client_identifier=s6BhdRkqt3

   Upon receiving an authorization request by the client, the
   authorization server generates a device verification code and a user
   verification code.  These are included in the HTTP response body
   using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content type as defined
   by [W3C.REC-html40-19980424] with a 200 status code (OK).  The
   response contains the following REQUIRED parameters:

   oauth_device_code  The device verification code.

   oauth_user_code  The user verification code.

   oauth_verification_url  The user verification URL on the
      authorization server.

   The authorization server MAY also include the following parameters:

   oauth_verification_token_expires_in  The lifetime of the two
      verification codes in seconds.

   oauth_verification_rate_limit  The minimum amount of time in seconds
      that the client SHOULD wait between polling requests to the device
      authorization URL.

   For example:

Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 DRAFT                    Mar 2010


    HTTP/1.1 200 OK
    Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

    oauth_device_code=74tq5miHKB&oauth_user_code=94248&oauth_verification_url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww%2Eexample%2Ecom%2Fdevice&oauth_verification_rate_limit=3

   The client MUST display the user verification URL and the user
   verification code to the end-user, instruct them to visit the user
   verification URL in a web browser, and to enter the user verification
   token upon doing so (a user authorization request).

   The way in which the authorization server handles the user
   authorization request, including whether it uses a secure channel
   such as TLS/SSL is beyond the scope of this specification.  However,
   the server MUST first verify the identity of the resource owner.
   After doing so, the server MUST prompt the end-user to enter the user
   verification code.

   The authorization server MUST verify that the user verification code
   is valid and MAY verify that the client is authorized to use this
   profile.  If the request is authorized, the authorization server
   directs the end-user to go back to the client device and follow its
   instructions.

   The client MAY have an interface element (such as a button) that the
   end-user interacts with to communicate that they have finished the
   authorization process.  The client MAY initiate the following request
   at an arbitrary but reasonable interval in order to create a more
   responsive user experience though MUST NOT exceed the verification
   rate limit if one is specified.  The Client MAY both poll and have an
   interface element, but MUST NOT have neither.

   The client constructs an HTTP "POST" request to the access token
   request endpoint and includes the following REQUIRED parameters:

   oauth_mode  The parameter value MUST be set to "profile_device" (case
      sensitive).

   oauth_client_identifier  The client identifier.

   oauth_device_verification_code  The device verification code.

   Since the request results in the transmission of plain text
   credentials in the HTTP response, the authorization server MUST
   require the use of a transport-layer mechanism such as TLS or SSL (or
   a secure channel with equivalent protections).

   For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request:

Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 DRAFT                    Mar 2010


    POST /access_token HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    oauth_client_identifier=s6BhdRkqt3&oauth_device_verification_code=J2vC42OifV

   If the request is authorized, the access token is included in the
   HTTP response body using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded"
   content type as defined by [W3C.REC-html40-19980424] with a 200
   status code (OK).  The response contains the following REQUIRED
   parameter:

   oauth_access_token  The access token.

   The authorization server MAY also include the following parameters:

   oauth_access_token_expires_in  The lifetime of the access token in
      seconds.

   For example:

       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

       oauth_access_token=FJQbwq9OD8&oauth_access_token_expires_in=600

   If the authorization server is unable to issue an access token to the
   client, the HTTP response body uses the "application/
   x-www-form-urlencoded" content type as defined by
   [W3C.REC-html40-19980424] with a 401 status code (Unauthorized).  The
   response contains the following REQUIRED parameter:

   oauth_error_reason  Value must be one of "authorization_declined",
      "authorization_pending", "slow_down", or
      "verification_code_expired" (case sensitive).

   For example:

       HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
       WWW-Authenticate: OAuth realm="https://server.example.com/"

       oauth_error_reason=authorization_pending

2.5.  Username and Password Profile

   This profile is used when the authorization server generally trusts
   the client to temporarily collect the end-user's username and
   password and it is impossible to use one of the other authorization
   profiles.  This profile enables a client to act on behalf of the
   resource owner without having to permanently store their username and

   password.

   Prior to making a request using this profile, the client MUST have
   obtained a client identifier, client secret, and access token request
   endpoint URI from the authorization server.  How the client prompts
   the resource owner for their username and password is beyond the
   scope of this specification.  The client MUST discard the resource
   owner's username and password once an access token has been obtained.

   The client constructs an HTTP "POST" request to the access token
   request endpoint and includes the following REQUIRED parameters:

   oauth_mode  The parameter value MUST be set to
      "profile_username_password" (case sensitive).

   oauth_client_identifier  The client identifier.

   oauth_client_secret  The client secret.

   oauth_username  The resource owner's username.

   oauth_password  The resource owner's password.

   The client MAY also include the following OPTIONAL parameters:

   oauth_scope  If the authorization server has defined a manner for the
      client to request certain capabilities of the access token, this
      parameter SHOULD be used to do so.

   Since the request results in the transmission of plain text
   credentials in both the HTTP request and response, the authorization
   server MUST require the use of a transport-layer mechanism such as
   TLS or SSL (or a secure channel with equivalent protections).

   For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request:

    POST /access_token HTTP/1.1
    Host: server.example.com
    oauth_client_identifier=s6BhdRkqt3&oauth_client_secret=8eSEIpnqmM&oauth_username=daveman692&oauth_password=1password

   The authorization server MUST verify that the resource owner's
   credentials are accurate and MAY verify that the client is authorized
   to use this profile.  If the request is authorized, the access token
   is included in the HTTP response body using the "application/
   x-www-form-urlencoded" content type as defined by
   [W3C.REC-html40-19980424] with a 200 status code (OK).

   The response contains the following REQUIRED parameters:

Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 DRAFT                    Mar 2010


   oauth_access_token  The access token.

   oauth_refresh_token  The refresh token.

   The authorization server MAY also include the following parameters:

   oauth_access_token_expires_in  The lifetime of the access token in
      seconds.

   For example:

       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

       oauth_access_token=FJQbwq9OD8&oauth_refresh_token=gO3CHNqpH8

   The server must retain the scope, duration, and other attributes
   approved by the resource owner, and enforce these restrictions when
   receiving a client request made with the tokens issued.

   Once the client receives and stores the token credentials, it can
   proceed to access protected resources on behalf of the resource owner
   by making authenticated requests (Section 4) using the access token
   received.

   If the request fails verification, the authorization server SHOULD
   respond with the appropriate HTTP response status code.  The
   authorization server MAY include further details about why the
   request was rejected in the response body.

   For example:

       HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
       WWW-Authenticate: OAuth realm="https://server.example.com/"

2.6.  Client Identifier and Secret Profile

   This profile is suitable when the client is also the resource owner
   and thus not accessing protected resources within the context of a
   given end-user.  For example, when a client is accessing non-private
   data or modifying data about itself.  This profile SHOULD NOT be used
   when the client is acting on behalf of an end-user.

   Prior to making a request using this profile, the client MUST have
   obtained a client identifier, client secret, and access token request
   endpoint URI from the authorization server.

   The client constructs an HTTP "POST" request to the access token

   request endpoint and includes the following REQUIRED parameters:

   oauth_mode  The parameter value MUST be set to "profile_client" (case
      sensitive).

   oauth_client_identifier  The client identifier.

   oauth_client_secret  The client secret.

   The client MAY also include the following OPTIONAL parameters:

   oauth_scope  If the authorization server has defined a manner for the
      client to request certain capabilities of the access token, this
      parameter SHOULD be used to do so.

   Since the request results in the transmission of plain text
   credentials in both the HTTP request and response, the authorization
   server MUST require the use of a transport-layer mechanism such as
   TLS or SSL (or a secure channel with equivalent protections).

   For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request:

       POST /access_token HTTP/1.1
       Host: server.example.com
       oauth_client_identifier=s6BhdRkqt3&oauth_client_secret=8eSEIpnqmM

   The authorization server MUST verify that the resource owner has
   authorized the provisioning of an access token to the client.  If the
   request is authorized, the access token is included in the HTTP
   response body using the "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content
   type as defined by [W3C.REC-html40-19980424] with a 200 status code
   (OK).

   The response contains the following REQUIRED parameters:

   oauth_access_token  The access token.

   oauth_refresh_token  The refresh token.

   The authorization server MAY also include the following parameters:

   oauth_access_token_expires_in  The lifetime of the access token in
      seconds.

   For example:

Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 DRAFT                    Mar 2010


       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

       oauth_access_token=FJQbwq9OD8&oauth_refresh_token=gO3CHNqpH8

   The server must retain the scope, duration, and other attributes
   approved by the resource owner, and enforce these restrictions when
   receiving a client request made with the tokens issued.

   Once the client receives and stores the token credentials, it can
   proceed to access protected resources on behalf of the resource owner
   by making authenticated requests (Section 4) using the access token
   received.

   If the request fails verification, the authorization server SHOULD
   respond with the appropriate HTTP response status code.  The
   authorization server MAY include further details about why the
   request was rejected in the response body.

   For example:

       HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
       WWW-Authenticate: OAuth realm="https://server.example.com/"


3.  Refreshing an Access Token

   Authorization servers MAY issue access tokens that expire and thus
   require clients to refresh them.  A client determines that an access
   token needs refreshing either by using the access token's expiration
   information or upon receiving the HTTP 401 Unauthorized response when
   accessing protected resources per Section 4.

   Prior to making a request using this profile, the client MUST have
   obtained a client identifier, client secret, and access token request
   endpoint URI from the authorization server.

   The client constructs an HTTP "POST" request to the access token
   request endpoint and includes the following REQUIRED parameters:

   oauth_mode  The parameter value MUST be set to "refresh_token" (case
      sensitive).

   oauth_client_identifier  The client identifier.

Internet-Draft               OAuth 2.0 DRAFT                    Mar 2010


   oauth_client_secret  The client secret.

   oauth_refresh_token  The refresh token associated with the access
      token to be refreshed.

   Since the request results in the transmission of plain text
   credentials in both the HTTP request and response, the authorization
   server MUST require the use of a transport-layer mechanism such as
   TLS or SSL (or a secure channel with equivalent protections).

   For example, the client makes the following HTTPS request:

POST /refresh_token HTTP/1.1
Host: server.example.com
oauth_client_identifier=s6BhdRkqt3&oauth_client_secret=8eSEIpnqmM&oauth_refresh_token=n4E9O119d

   The authorization server MUST verify that the resource owner has
   still authorized the provisioning of an access token to the client
   and that the refresh token is valid.  If the request is authorized,
   the access token is included in the HTTP response body using the
   "application/x-www-form-urlencoded" content type as defined by
   [W3C.REC-html40-19980424] with a 200 status code (OK).

   The response contains the following REQUIRED parameters:

   oauth_access_token  The access token.

   The authorization server MAY also include the following parameters:

   oauth_access_token_expires_in  The lifetime of the access token in
      seconds.

   For example:

       HTTP/1.1 200 OK
       Content-Type: application/x-www-form-urlencoded

       oauth_access_token=8F44J2HGMl

   If the request fails verification, the authorization server SHOULD
   respond with the appropriate HTTP response status code.  The
   authorization server MAY include further details about why the
   request was rejected in the response body.

   For example:

       HTTP/1.1 401 Authorization Required
       WWW-Authenticate: OAuth realm="https://server.example.com/"

4.  Accessing a Protected Resource

   TODO: This section is really a combination of WRAP and OAuth 1.0.
   SSL support will be a MUST and signatures will be optional.

4.1.  Using TLS/SSL

   TODO: The SSL section basically copies directly from WRAP section #4.
   It's about a page and a half and really easy to implement.

4.2.  Using Signatures

   TODO: We need to agree on the signature method though there is a lot
   of normative text in the OAuth 1.0 spec to draw from.  OAuth 1.0 is
   about three pages of text assuming people are happy with the
   mechanism; it would be good to simplify as much as possible.  We
   could modify WRAP's refresh token request to let the client specify
   that they'd also like an access token secret for that request.  This
   seems like the right way of doing it.


5.  Security Considerations

   TODO: I'm the wrong person to write this section.
